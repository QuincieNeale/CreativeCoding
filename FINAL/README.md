Project 2 for Creative Coding Class, interactivity project using animation.

This project uses animation code to create a moving animation.
I am mainly an artist and I come from a Polish background. I wanted to incorporate Polish Folk art into my animation. I was focusing on the idea that culture, when influenced by other sources, is often altered or changed. So when people interact with this cultural piece they can control in a way how it changes.

I used Dan Wilcox's code:
animation

When you run the program you can move your cursor toward the top of the screen to slow down the fram rate and toward the bottom to speed it up. If you click the animation will freeze, to unfreeze the animation just move the mouse.
